# Cubo and AutoGit functions

## About this collection

The cubo folders bundles scripts used for the seamless integration of the corpus-services into a setup of working on corpora with GitLab and Mattermost. It can be adapted to other use cases as well. It is intended to be used on a unix server.

While it is very specialized on a certain setting and use case, we are happy to answer questions about it.

# crontab

`crontab-example.bak` contains the cronjobs that are used for the various scripts. If you want to use it, make sure to adapt `/path/to/` and the Mattermost Webhook hashes needed.

# folders

Also please make sure to replace all the XXXXXX for Redmine, Mattermost oder GitLab tokens with your generated tokens.
